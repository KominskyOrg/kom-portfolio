      DevOps & Site Reliability Engineer

      <p class="text-lg">
        I design, build, and maintain cloud-native systems that are scalable, resilient, and
        efficient. My work centers on bridging Site Reliability Engineering principles with
        DevOps practices to deliver infrastructure that enables rapid development without
        compromising reliability. When I'm not optimizing Kubernetes clusters or building
        Terraform modules, you can find me immersed in hydroponic gardening, playing tennis,
        traveling, or exploring new culinary delights.

    <div class="text-3xl w-full font-bold mb-2">Professional Journey</div>
    <div class="py-2">
      <p class="text-lg">
        With 4+ years owning production Kubernetes and AWS infrastructure, I've delivered
        measurable impact at every role. At Groups360, I reduced infrastructure costs by 40%
        through resource right-sizing, cut observability spend by 35% via strategic Datadog
        optimization, and led the migration from manual EKS provisioning to Terraform
        infrastructure as code. I also drove the adoption of Argo CD GitOps workflows,
        built autoscaling CI infrastructure using GitHub Actions Runner Controller, and
        automated management of 200+ repositories with Terraform.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mt-4">
        At Built Technologies, I implemented monitoring for 40+ microservices that reduced
        incident response time by 75%, defined SLIs/SLOs aligned with business priorities,
        and built test automation that cut CI/CD cycle time by 75%. My approach combines
        technical depth with a focus on cost optimization, operational efficiency, and
        enabling development teams to ship faster.

      <p class="text-lg">
        I'm currently focused on building tools that solve real problems in the DevOps space:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 text-lg space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>UnifyOps</strong> — An Internal Developer Platform (IDP) with a drag-and-drop
          infrastructure designer, built with FastAPI, React/TypeScript, and deployed to
          bare-metal Kubernetes via GitOps
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Job Scanner</strong> — An LLM-powered automation pipeline using GPT-4 for
          intelligent job screening, fit scoring, and automated outreach generation
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Auth Platform</strong> — A production-ready microservices authentication
          system with JWT flows, deployed via Helm charts to self-hosted Harbor registry
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stack Templates</strong> — Reusable microservice scaffolding implementing
          three-tier architecture patterns with pre-configured CI/CD
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-lg mt-4">
        All projects are deployed to my home lab infrastructure — bare-metal Kubernetes
        running on personal servers with Harbor registry, demonstrating end-to-end DevOps
        practices from code to production.

        My dedication to excellence has been recognized through awards including the
        <strong>Built Onward Award</strong> at Built Technologies, given to less than 10%
        of team members for exceptional work ethic and sustained impact. At Belmont University,
        I received the <strong>Stephen Campbell Math & Computer Science Award</strong> (one
        recipient per year) and consistently made the Dean's List. These achievements reflect
        my commitment to both professional and academic excellence.

      <p class="text-lg">
        I'm always eager to connect with teams building reliable, scalable infrastructure.
        Whether you're looking for someone to own your Kubernetes platform, optimize your
        observability stack, or implement GitOps workflows — let's talk. I'm also happy
        to chat about hydroponic systems, tennis, or the best restaurants in Nashville.
